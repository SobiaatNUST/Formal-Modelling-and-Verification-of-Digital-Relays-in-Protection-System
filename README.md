# Formal-Modelling-and-Verification-of-Digital-Relays-in-Protection-System

In this work we have developed the formal model of a digital relay equipped with the protection and signal dispatching , and supervisory capabilities as well as the formal model of communication model and control unit. These models are used for analyzing the protection system. The proposed methodology uses the probabilistic model checker PRISM to verify the reliability and safety properties.
